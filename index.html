            <p class="about__us">
                For many years, Bethany pie has been baking delicious pies at home.
                In 2003, we opened our first store in Brussel(Belgium) in a cosy litte street near the grand market.
                People from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
                
                In 2015, on less than 100 pies were sold everyday and Bethany's Pie shop moved into a larger building. After 
                receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the comfort of your 
                home from anywhere in the world. you are now looking at the result of this: our own webstore and more branch in various countries making it possible to enjoy 
                Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
